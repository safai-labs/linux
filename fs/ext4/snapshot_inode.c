 * In-memory snapshot list manipulation is protected by snapshot_mutex.
 * In this function we read the in-memory snapshot list without holding
 * snapshot_mutex, because we don't want to slow down snapshot read performance.
 * Following is a proof, that even though we don't hold snapshot_mutex here,
 * reading the list is safe from races with snapshot list delete and add (take).
 *
 * Proof of no race with snapshot delete:
 * --------------------------------------
 * We get here only when reading from an enabled snapshot or when reading
 * through from an enabled snapshot to a newer snapshot.  Snapshot delete
 * operation is only allowed for a disabled snapshot, when no older enabled
 * snapshot exists (i.e., the deleted snapshot in not 'in-use').  Hence,
 * read through is safe from races with snapshot list delete operations.
 *
 * Proof of no race with snapshot take:
 * ------------------------------------
 * Snapshot B take is composed of the following steps:
 * ext4_snapshot_create():
 * - Add snapshot B to head of list (active_snapshot is A).
 * - Allocate and copy snapshot B initial blocks.
 * ext4_snapshot_take():
 * - Freeze FS
 * - Clear snapshot A 'active' flag.
 * - Set snapshot B 'list'+'active' flags.
 * - Set snapshot B as active snapshot (active_snapshot=B).
 * - Unfreeze FS
 *
 * Note that we do not need to rely on correct order of instructions within
 * each of the functions above, but we can assume that Freeze FS will provide
 * a strong barrier between adding B to list and the ops inside snapshot_take.
 *
 * When reading from snapshot A during snapshot B take, we have 2 cases:
 * 1. is_active(A) is tested before setting active_snapshot=B -
 *    read through from A to block device.
 * 2. is_active(A) is tested after setting active_snapshot=B -
 *    read through from A to B.
 *
 * When reading from snapshot B during snapshot B take, we have 2 cases:
 * 1. B->flags and B->prev are read before adding B to list
 *    AND/OR before setting the 'list'+'active' flags -
 *    access to B denied.
 * 2. is_active(B) is tested after setting active_snapshot=B
 *    AND/OR after setting the 'list'+'active' flags -
 *    read through from B to block device.
